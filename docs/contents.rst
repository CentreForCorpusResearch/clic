The purpose of CLiC
===================

The CLiC webapp provides an easy, mobile-friendly user interface that enables users to explore
literary texts using corpus linguistics. 

It comes with a pre-defined set of literary texts. The app can be used at ``clic.bham.ac.uk``. 


Installing CLiC
===============

Quick start
-----------

To deploy a local or public CLiC server, one needs:
     - Docker
     - the CLiC Docker image
     - the pre-processed cheshire3 indexes (for the Concordance, Clusters, and Keywords)
     - a selection of pre-processed text files (for the Subsets, Patterns, and the User Annotation)


Test the installation:


CLiC for developers
-------------------

Cheshire3 uses a number of packages that are no longer updated. That makes a simple
 ``pip install`` impossible (or, let's say, complex at the least).
