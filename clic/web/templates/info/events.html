         A new version of CLiC has been released. Here are a number of highlights in the latest release:

        <ul>
			<li>The Keyword Extraction Algorithm has completely been refactored. Its results now match the log likelihood ratio formula as explained by Rayson and Garside (2000, cf. 
 				<a href="{{url_for('documentation')}}">Documentation</a>). The keywords are now extensively tested and the clusters and keywords pages contain the information of the parameters. 
				</li>
			<li>The non-quote extraction algorithm has been improved to contain selection before the first quote in a chapter. This affects concordance searches, keywords and clusters.</li>
			<li>We have renamed the parameters in URLs so one can easily edit them and share the URLs with other researchers.</li>
			<li>We have fixed the concordance searches in short suspensions.</li>
            <li>Keywords and clusters for 3- and 4-grams in short suspensions are now available.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
    <p>We are still working on more fine-grained token and cluster counts. Currently, non-quote and quote token counts do not add up to the total token count.</p>
	<p>Based on feedback from our users, we have fixed the column width in the keywords and clusters pages and we have added a number of help pages that explain basic usage. We have also fixed a bug that resulted in 1-grams when 5-grams were asked. </p>
