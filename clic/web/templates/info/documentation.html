          <p>NB: The current total cluster counts of quotes and non-quotes do not add up to
          the total cluster counts in the whole text. This is a known issue on which we are working.

		  <h3>Keywords</h3>

		  <p>The keywords page allows you to compare to corpora and two subsets with each other in order to find 
    		 the clusters that are statisically significantly more frequently used in a corpus.
		  </p>

 
          The keyword extraction formula is taken from 

          <p style="padding-left:2em">

          <h2>About the project</h2>

          <p>CLiC (Corpus Linguistics in Cheshire) is developed as part of an AHRC-funded project: “<a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/CRAL/Projects/CLiC.aspx">CLiC Dickens - Characterisation in the representation of speech and body language from a corpus linguistic perspective</a>”.</p>

          <p>The project demonstrates through corpus stylistics how computer-assisted methods can be used to study literary texts and lead to new insights into how readers perceive fictional characters.</p>
          <p>CLiC specifically supports the analysis of fictional speech and literary body language by enabling the user to search in particular parts of the texts, e.g. in quotes, which typically contain the direct speech of fictional characters in the novels.</p>
          <p>Initially, the texts that can be searched will be Dickens’s novels and novels written by other 19th century authors.</p>

          <p>For feedback and questions please contact us on email <a href="mailto:clic@nottingham.ac.uk">clic@nottingham.ac.uk</a>.</p>
