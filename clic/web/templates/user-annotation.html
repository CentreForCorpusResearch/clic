    <h3 class="without-pills">Access is restricted</h3>
      <p>The annotation tool is not available to the public. If you
        want to gain access to this tool in order to annotate occurrences of
        subsets with tags and notes, please email
        <a href="mailto:clic@contacts.bham.ac.uk?Subject=Get%20access" target="_top">the
          CLiC team</a> to ask for a user account. If you want to set up your own
          version of the CLiC user annotation, please visit our <a href="
          {{url_for('releases')}}">Releases</a> page and install CLiC locally.

    <h3 class="without-pills">Goal</h3>
      <p>The annotation tool allows you to add notes and tags to subsets in order to analyse them
        systematically. </p>
      <p>The subset page contains all the subsets (e.g. quotes, short suspensions, long suspensions,
        and non-quotes).
        To search the text of the subsets use the search box on the subset page.
        To sort the columns, click on the column title. Advanced functionality (for instance, filtering) is explained
        below. </p>
    <h3 class="without-pills">How to add a tag or a note?</h3>
     <p>To define a tag or a note navigate to the Tag and
        Note pages and click on the <i>Create</i> button.

        <img class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid blue; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px" src="/img/docs/step1.png" >


        To add a tag "body language", for instance, enter the name of your tag into the
        designated field and hit <i>save</i>.

        <img class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid blue; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px" src="/img/docs/step2.png" >


        Once a tag or a note
        are created, navigate to the subset page and click on the pencil next to a subset row
        to add any available tags or notes.

        In the pop-up window that opens, click on the "Tags" field and select the tag
        you want to connect to the row.

        <img class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid blue; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px" src="/img/docs/step4.png" >

        If you click save, the row will now have your tag (in our example, body language)
        associated with it.

        <img class="img-responsive" style="border: 1px solid blue; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px" src="/img/docs/step5.png" >

        To delete a tag click the bin
        (this deletes it from *all* of the subsets it was attached to).
      </p>

      <h3 class="without-pills">The purpose of the filter</h3>
          The purpose of the filter is to allow the researcher the greatest flexibility
          in the selection of subsets. Because you can apply multiple filters, it is possible
          to select all subsets which occur in a books and which have a specific tag, for instance.
    <h3 class="without-pills">How to filter the subsets?</h3>
        The subset page has a filter that you should use if you want to select subsets that meet
        specific criteria. You can add multiple filters at the same time. To use the filter
        <ol>
          <li>click on the <i>Filter</i> link </li>
          <li>specify three parameters: what column you want to filter, a filter type (for instance,
            contains, equals, in list, etc.), and what you expect the filter to
            match in the field </li>
          <li>apply the filter by clicking <i>Apply</i> on the right-hand side.</li>
        </ol>
        Repeat the process if you want to add multiple filters as in the screenshot above. Once a filter
        is applied it can be reset using the <i>Reset</i> button on the right-hand side.
        <h3 class="without-pills">Filtering on the <i>Kind</i> of subset</h3>
            To easily filter the subsets using the kind of subset, here is the list of subsets
            contained in the database:
                <ul>
                  <li>long suspensions</li>
                  <li>short suspensions</li>
                  <li>non quotes</li>
                  <li>quotes</li>
                </ul>
            You can use the full name of the kind of subset, or to use only a part
            of it (for instance, <i>contains: suspension</i> will find all subsets of which the kind
            contains the word <i>suspension</i>).

    <h3 class="without-pills">How to filter the subsets for specific tags/notes?</h3>
        If you have added tags and/or notes to the subsets, it is possible to use the filtering
        mechanism described above to filter on a tag/note. To do so, select <i>Tags / Name</i>
        or <i>Notes / Note</i> from the filter dropdown menu and write (a part of) the text of the
        note or Tag. Hit apply to filter the results.
    <h3 class="without-pills">How to perform a phrase search?</h3>
          The text filter
          allows searching for phrases (for instance, <i>I don't know what I</i>).
          No quotation marks are needed.

    <h3 class="without-pills">Quick searches</h3>
      The purpose of the main search box is to allow for quick searches in the entire corpus.
      It is combines searches using abbreviations and text. You can search for
      <i>BH sir</i>, for instance, to search for <i>sir</i> in <i>Bleak House</i>. The search is not
      limited to word boundaries (hence the use of filters for phrase searches). To search for entries starting with a specific word, use
      <i>^</i> as in, <i>^said</i>.

    <h3 class="without-pills">Exporting subsets</h3>
       Up to 2000 subsets can be exported using the export link next to the filter.
       This export can take place <i>after</i> the filtering.
